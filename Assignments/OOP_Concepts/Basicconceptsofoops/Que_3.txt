//What is the difference between OOP and POP? 

OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) and POP(Procedural Oriented Programming) are two fundamental programming 
paradigms that differ in their approach to structuring and organizing code. Here's a breakdown of their 
key differences:

Core Focus:

OOP: Focuses on data and the objects that represent real-world entities. Data is tightly coupled with the 
methods that operate on it.
POP: Focuses on procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. Data is often treated separately from
the functions that manipulate it.

Program Structure:

OOP: Organizes programs around objects and their interactions. Objects encapsulate data and behavior.
POP: Organizes programs as a sequence of procedures or functions that perform specific steps to achieve a 
goal.

Data Security:

OOP: Encapsulation promotes data security by restricting direct access to an object's data. Access is 
controlled through methods within the class.
POP: Data is often globally accessible throughout the program, making it more susceptible to accidental 
modification.
Code Reusability:

OOP: Inheritance allows creating new classes from existing ones, promoting code reuse and reducing 
redundancy.
POP: Code reuse can be achieved through functions, but it's generally less efficient and flexible 
compared to OOP's inheritance.

Complexity Management:

OOP: Well-designed OOP code can be more modular and easier to maintain for complex projects due to 
encapsulation and inheritance.
POP: Large POP programs can become difficult to manage as functions become complex and data dependencies 
increase.

Choosing Between OOP and POP:

OOP: Ideal for complex applications where data security, reusability, and maintainability are crucial. 
Examples include games, simulations, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
POP: Still relevant for smaller, less complex tasks or situations where performance might be a priority. 
Examples include scripting or data processing tasks.
In summary, OOP provides a more structured and secure approach to building complex applications, while 
POP offers a simpler way to handle smaller tasks. The choice between them depends on the specific project 
requirements and the desired level of code organization and maintainability.
