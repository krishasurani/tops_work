â€¢ What is Normalization?  
Ans : Normalization is a database design technique data redundancy 
and eliminates undesirable characteristics like insertion, Update and 
Deletion Anomalies. Normalization rules divides larger tables into 
smaller table and links them using relationship. The purpose of 
Normalisation in SQL is to eliminate redundant (repetitive) data and 
ensure data is stored logically. 

There are several levels of normalization, each with its own set of rules:

1. First Normal Form (1NF):
Eliminates repeating groups:


2. Second Normal Form (2NF):
Must be in 1NF.
Eliminates partial dependencies

3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
Must be in 2NF.
Eliminates transitive dependencies
Additional Normal Forms

Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): A stricter versi
Fourth Normal Form (4NF): Eliminates multi-valued dependencies
Fifth Normal Form (5NF): Eliminates all join dependencies

Benefits of Normalization:
Reduced data redundancy
Improved data integrity
Enhanced data efficiency
