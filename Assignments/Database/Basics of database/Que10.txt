• What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL? 
Ans :A trigger in SQL is a special kind of stored procedure that automatically executes when specific events occur 
in the database. These events can be INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table or a view. Triggers are used 
to enforce business rules, maintain audit trails, and replicate data, among other uses.

Creating a Trigger
To create a trigger, you use the CREATE TRIGGER statement, specifying the event that will cause the trigger to
fire and the actions that the trigger should perform.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create a trigger:

1.Specify the Trigger Name: Choose a name for your trigger.
2.Specify the Table: Identify the table on which the trigger will be applied.
3.Specify the Event: Define the event that will fire the trigger (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE).
4.Define the Timing: Specify whether the trigger should fire BEFORE or AFTER the event.
5.Write the Trigger Action: Define the SQL statements to be executed when the trigger fires.
